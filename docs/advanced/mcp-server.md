# MCP Server

Model Context Protocol (MCP) server support is planned for future releases.

## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a protocol that enables AI models to interact with external tools and data sources in a standardized way.

## Planned Features

### Task Management
- Real-time task synchronization
- Context-aware task suggestions
- Automated priority assignment

### Project Analysis
- Code-to-task correlation
- Progress tracking
- Dependency detection

### Integration Points
- IDE extensions
- CI/CD pipelines
- Project management tools

## Usage (Future)

```bash
# Start MCP server
pcheck mcp serve

# Connect from AI tool
# (Implementation details TBD)
```

## Benefits

1. **Seamless Integration** - AI tools can directly manage tasks
2. **Rich Context** - AI understands project structure and progress
3. **Automation** - Reduce manual task management overhead
4. **Standardization** - Works with any MCP-compatible AI tool
